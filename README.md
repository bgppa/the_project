Hello people,

I am collecting here some ideas concerning the use of the Signature Transform
in the context of Time Series Analysis.

At the moment, my idea is to simply collect two packages capable of offering
support for two tasks:
1) Time Series Manipulation, in order to prepare data...
2) Signature Tools, to be used on the preprocessed data.

I am writing this code for me, but I will always try to be as clear as possible.
We will see :-)

Have a nice day
