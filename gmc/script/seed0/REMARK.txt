We reported in the plots the overall accuracy on the full dataset,
	but in all the examples the training and the validation accuracy were
	always very close.

The plots are helpful for the visualization, fur our human eye.
	But the actual computations for the clustering are directly done
	on the higher dimensional space where the signature lives.
